          <h2><center>About Me</center></h2>
          <p>As a go-seeker, my passions have driven me to expand my knowledge and to move from Brazil to the United States to pursue my undergraduate studies at the University of Miami. I major in Managemnt & Marketing and my biggest passions include International Culinary and Hospitality. While I have strong analytical skills, I also have a creative side. My different personality traits work perfectly side by side and are what make me a strong critical thinker and natural leader.
